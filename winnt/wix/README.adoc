This directory contains auxiliary files to create Windows installer.
See link:../../doc/HOWTO-mingw.adoc[doc/HOWTO-mingw.adoc] for the build instructions.

`libiconv-COPYING.LIB` (LGPL) is to be included in the installer, for we
have a copy of `libiconv.dll` in it.  The rest of the distribution is
under BSD license.

/* Memotable is a mapping specialized for memoization.
   It has several characteristics we can take advantage of, and
   several specific requrements, than the generic hashtables.

   - Must be thread-safe.
   - No explicit deletion.
   - Multiple entries of the same key can exist, for it won't affect outcome.
   - Entries can dissapear at any time.  It simply causes recompuation.
   - No need to iterate over the table.
   - Its key is a list of arguments.  We don't want equal?-hash, for
     it would recurse into each arguments unnecessarily.  We use a
     tailored hash function and equality predicate.
 */

/* The storage contains flat array of entries.

   If num_keys argument is a positive number, that many keys are stored
   directly in the storage:

            +-------------+
    Entry > |   hashval   |
            +-------------+
            |    key 0    |
            +-------------+
            :             :
            +-------------+
            |   key n-1   |
            +-------------+
            |    value    |
            +-------------+

   If num_keys is 0 or less, the last key entry has list of "rest" keys.
   The absolute value of num_keys specifies number of mandatory keys.

            +-------------+
    Entry > |   hashval   |
            +-------------+
            |    key 0    |
            +-------------+
            :             :
            +-------------+
            |   key n-1   |
            +-------------+
            |      -----------> (key ...)
            +-------------+
            |    value    |
            +-------------+

   The hashval slots may be:

     0..00   - Unused entry.
     0..10   - Invalid entry.  It won't stop probing, but the entry is
               unusable until table GC/expansion.
     x..x1   - If LSB is 1, the rest of the bits contains a shifted hash value.
               It is used to skip over the entry during probing.
     x..00   - Non zero entry with LSBs being 00.  This is a pointer to the
               <thread> that is building the entry.

   It is important that once an entry is created, the key-value association
   won't change.  (Except when the table is weak and either key or value is
   GC-ed.)


  Lookup

   - Compute a hash value modulo table capacity.
   - Start probing from entries[hashval%capacity]
       - h = LOAD(entry->hashval)
       - if h == 0
          probe failed.
       - if h & 0x01 == 1
            &&  h>>1 == hashval
            && all keys match
            && value != 0
          found.
       - otherwise, advance to the next entry and re-probe, until
         maximum re-probe count reaches.

  Insertion

   - Compute a hash value modulo table capacity.
   - Start probing form entries[hashval%capacity]
       - h = LOAD(entry->hashval)
       - if h == 0
          CAS(&entry->hashval, 0, Scm_VM())
          - if success
              fill the entry, then STORE(entry->hashval, ((hashval<<1) & 1))
          - else
              advance to the next entry and re-probe (*1)
       - if h & 0x01 == 1
            &&  h>>1 == hashval
            && all keys match
          STORE(value) (*2)
       - otherwise, advance to the next entry and re-probe
         - If maximum re-probe count reaches.

      (*1) This can cause duplicate entries if the other thread is inserting
           the same key&value there, but it's ok.
      (*2) This is idempotent.  However, if value reference is weak,
           the value slot can be 0.  We can safely reuse the entry.

  Dissapearing pointers

   If the table is weak, any key or value slot can become 0 after GC.

   - Value becomes 0 - We simply skip the entry during lookup, and set the
     value during insertion.  The same keys always yield the same value, so
     there's no race.

   - Key becomes 0 - The entry becomes invalid, for it will never match
     valid keys.

   When these conditions are found during traversal, we set the value to 0
   and the entry header to 0x10, in this order.

    - Setting value to 0 makes other threads that are reading keys
      recognize the entry is invalid.
    - Setting the header to 0x10 let future readers know this entry is
      invalid immediatly.

  Table GC/expansion

   During insertion, if we can't find an unused entry until the certain
   number of re-probing, we have to make room.  We allocate a new
   stroage and rebuild the table, then swap the pointer to the storage.
   New entries added after copying and swapping may be lost, but that's ok
   for our purpose.

   During copying, these operations will make room:

   - If the entry is invalid, it is just ignored.
   - If the table is expandable, a bigger storage is allocated.
   - If the table is not expandable, drop one of the existing entry.
 */

/* Weakness.  The table can be made so that pointers to keys and values
   all weak, to avoid retaining too much data.  For memoization, dropping
   references merely triggers recalculation, and the outcome won't change.

   If we keep the list of keys (num_keys == 0), there's an increased
   chance that the key disappears even while value is alive, reducing
   the hit rate.  If the value retains the reference to the key list,
   we don't need to worry.
